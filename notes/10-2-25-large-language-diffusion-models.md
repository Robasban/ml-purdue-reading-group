# Large Language Diffusion Models
- Presenter: Oskar Jonientz

## Summary


## Notes
- Diffusion Models: these are models that can create new data by adding noise to existing data, which can be used to further test models
- LLaDA: a masked diffusion language model
  - Predicts entire sequences repeatedly, which keeps high-confidence tokens
  - Can generate multiple tokens in one pass
  - Model can predict previous outputs
  - Trained in two stages
    - Unsupervised pre-training
    - Supervised fine-tuning
  - Inference can work in three ways
    - Random remasking
    - Low-confidence remasking
    - Semi-autoregressive-origin
